Optimisation of a PID controller for single and multiple objectives (Final year university project)

For Sheffield University Genetic Algorithm toolbox open the "sga" or "sga(single objective)" to see the edited file
MATLAB Genetic Algorithm toolbox should be self-explanatory
For Particle Swarm optimisation open the "PSOwithboundingvelocityforapsobj" or "PSOwithboundingvelocityforap" to see the edited file
For MATLAB design optimisation toolbox (for Gradient Descent and Nelder Mead) open a toolbox session to see the optimisations
